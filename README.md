Hey there! 
I'm Roshini Das. 
I'm from Material Science and Nanotechnology background, but I've been diving into DATA for the past year and been impressed with it all.
- I'm currently working on building my portfolio for making it easier for those looking to start learning DS 
- I'm looking to collaborate on a project where DS based Nanotech or Material science reasearch is the goal
